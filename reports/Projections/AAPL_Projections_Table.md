| Year | Case | Revenue Growth (%) | EBIT Growth (%) | Net Income Growth (%) | Free Cash Flow Growth (%) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2026** | **Base** | 9.0% | 11.5% | 8.5% | 12.0% | "Apple Intelligence" drives a hardware super-cycle (iPhone 17) meeting Q1 guidance, though growth moderates in 2H due to tariff headwinds; margins expand on Services mix. |
| | **Bear** | 3.5% | 1.0% | -2.5% | -4.0% | Strong Q1 offset by escalating China demand weakness and tariff implementations ($1.4B impact) compressing margins; higher tax rate vs. FY25 drags Net Income. |
| | **Bull** | 13.5% | 17.0% | 15.5% | 19.0% | AI-driven upgrade cycle accelerates faster than anticipated; Services maintain 15%+ growth, and supply chain yields improve, negating tariff costs. |
| **2027** | **Base** | 6.5% | 7.5% | 9.0% | 8.0% | Post-cycle normalization; steady Services growth offsets hardware flatness. Buybacks support Net Income outpacing Revenue. |
| | **Bear** | -2.0% | -9.0% | -11.0% | -8.5% | Regulatory impact hits: Loss of Google search payments (antitrust remedy) severely impacts high-margin Services revenue; EU DMA forces take-rate reductions. |
| | **Bull** | 10.0% | 13.0% | 14.5% | 15.0% | Proprietary AI features become a subscription driver, increasing Services ARPU; China market returns to robust growth. |
| **2028** | **Base** | 5.5% | 6.5% | 8.0% | 7.5% | Mature ecosystem growth; continued shift to high-margin Services offsets hardware commoditization. AI CapEx stabilizes, aiding FCF. |
| | **Bear** | 1.5% | 2.0% | 3.0% | 2.5% | Stabilization at a lower margin profile post-regulatory restructuring; hardware sales sluggish due to extended replacement cycles. |
| | **Bull** | 8.5% | 11.0% | 12.5% | 13.0% | Expansion into new hardware categories (AR/VR iteration) and dominance in private-cloud AI processing reinforces ecosystem lock-in. |
| **2029** | **Base** | 5.0% | 6.0% | 7.5% | 7.0% | Steady state; emerging markets (India/SE Asia) compensate for saturated developed markets. |
| | **Bear** | 2.0% | 3.0% | 4.5% | 4.0% | Competition in AI/Hardware from Chinese OEMs limits pricing power; growth strictly tracks global GDP. |
| | **Bull** | 7.5% | 9.5% | 11.0% | 11.5% | Services segment comprises >35% of revenue, structurally lifting gross margins to ~50%; strong compounding cash returns. |
| **2030** | **Base** | 4.5% | 5.5% | 7.0% | 6.5% | Long-term equilibrium growth; OpEx leverage maximized as AI infrastructure build-out concludes. |
| | **Bear** | 2.0% | 2.5% | 4.0% | 3.5% | Business commoditized; reliance on replacement demand only with minimal Services pricing power. |
| | **Bull** | 7.0% | 9.0% | 10.5% | 11.0% | Sustained "walled garden" premium despite regulations; aggressive buybacks continue to drive double-digit EPS growth. |
| **TV** | **Base** | 3.0% | 3.0% | 3.0% | 3.0% | Terminal growth aligned with developed market GDP; assumes maintained market leadership but saturated penetration. |
| | **Bear** | 2.0% | 2.0% | 2.0% | 2.0% | Terminal growth reflects inflationary floor; assumes erosion of competitive moat. |
| | **Bull** | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | 4.0% | Premium valuation warranted by enduring brand equity and Services pricing power exceeding inflation. |
