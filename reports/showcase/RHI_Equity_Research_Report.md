## 1. Executive Summary & Investment Recommendation

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ticker Symbol** | NYSE: RHI |
| **Primary Exchange** | New York Stock Exchange |
| **Sector** | Business Services |
| **Industry** | Specialized Staffing & Consulting |
| **Investment Recommendation** | **Buy** |
| **Stock Price at Publication** | $27.73 |
| **Target Price** | $51 |

| **WACC** |**9.1%**|
| **Risk Level** | **High** |

**Rationale for Recommendation:**
We initiate coverage of Robert Half Inc. (RHI) with a **Buy** recommendation and a 12-month price target of **$51**. RHI represents a textbook example of a **mispriced cyclical recovery play**. The market has punished the stock excessively, driving shares down approximately 80% from their February 2022 peak. Contrast this with the company's operating cash flows, which have contracted by a more moderate ~40% over the same period. This dislocation implies that the market is pricing in a permanent impairment or a prolonged white-collar recession—a scenario we view as overly pessimistic.

Our base case target of $51, derived from our DCF model, implies an 84% upside. We have identified three forceful catalysts that will drive a re-rating:
1.  **Fed Policy Pivot:** The staffing industry is highly interest-rate sensitive. Anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts will lower the cost of capital, stimulating the business investment required to restart hiring cycles. We also expect a more dovish Fed chair to be appointed in May 2026, which will benefit RHI if this person leads the Fed to cut rates more aggressively.
2.  **Reshoring Spillover:** While manufacturing has been the initial beneficiary of reshoring, we anticipate a secondary wave of demand for white-collar support roles (finance, logistics, legal) where RHI specializes.
3.  **Labor Supply Constrictions:** Potential tightening of immigration policies (e.g., H1B visa restrictions) will squeeze the supply of skilled labor, forcing corporations to rely on RHI’s deep domestic talent networks.

While we maintain a **High** risk rating due to macroeconomic sensitivity and material unquantified legal risks (*Gentry v. RHI*), the current 8.6% dividend yield offers investors substantial compensation to wait for the likely cyclical turn.

## 2. Business Description

Robert Half Inc. (RHI) operates as a global leader in specialized talent solutions and business consulting. The company distinguishes itself through a hybrid model that integrates specialized staffing with high-value consulting capabilities. Operations are segmented into **Talent Solutions** (Contract and Permanent Placement) and **Protiviti** (Global Consulting).

### Products and Services

**1. Talent Solutions**
This core segment connects skilled professionals with clients in finance, accounting, technology, legal, and creative fields.
*   **Contract Talent Solutions:** Revenue is generated via billable hours. This segment is highly variable and sensitive to economic activity. Hours worked declined 14.6% in 2024 and 10.1% in Q3 2025, reflecting the current cyclical trough.
*   **Permanent Placement:** RHI earns fees as a percentage of annual salaries for direct hires. This is the most cyclical segment, evidenced by a 17.0% drop in placement volumes in 2024.

**2. Protiviti**
RHI's consulting arm specializes in internal audit, risk, compliance, and technology consulting. Protiviti leverages RHI’s staffing network to scale project teams efficiently, a key competitive differentiator. This segment has shown resilience, posting 1.1% growth in FY2024 and 9.6% international growth in the first nine months of 2025, driven by demand for regulatory compliance and AI governance (via the "Protiviti Atlas" platform).

### Company Economics and Key Drivers

RHI is a play on the economy and labor market strength/weakness with significant operating leverage.
*   **Revenue Drivers:** GDP growth, business confidence, interest rates, and unemployment rates are paramount. Protiviti adds a layer of stability through long-term consulting engagements.
*   **Expense Structure:** The cost of services is variable (wages), but SG&A includes significant fixed costs (rents, technology, admin salaries). In downturns, SG&A as a percentage of revenue rises (from 29.3% in 2022 to 34.7% in 2024), causing negative operating leverage. Conversely, this structure fuels explosive EBIT growth during recoveries. FCF as a percent of sales reached a high of 8.8% during the boom in 2021-2022, falling to 6.1% in 2024. We project a slow climb back to 7.5% margins by 2030 as the white collar labor market improves.
*   **Profitability:** Operating income has faced severe pressure (down 77.6% in Q3 2025). However, we project a 40% EBIT rebound in 2026 as revenue stabilizes and fixed costs are leveraged.

## 3. Industry Overview and Competitive Positioning

The specialized staffing industry acts as a leveraged barometer for global economic health. While the generalist staffing sector faces low barriers to entry and commoditization, RHI operates in specialized verticals (finance, tech, legal) where niche skills command pricing power.

**Industry Landscape**
The sector is currently navigating a cyclical trough characterized by client "destocking" of labor. However, structural shifts are underway. Remote work has expanded addressable talent pools, and AI is transforming operational efficiency. RHI is actively integrating AI for talent matching and lead generation, while Protiviti captures high-margin work in AI implementation and governance.

**Competitive Moat: Narrow**
We assign RHI a "Narrow" moat. While staffing has low entry barriers, RHI possesses durable advantages:
*   **Hybrid Model:** The synergy between Talent Solutions and Protiviti creates a cross-selling ecosystem difficult for pure-play rivals to replicate.
*   **Scale and Brand:** A global footprint in 17 countries and decades of brand equity foster client trust.
*   **Financial Fortitude:** Despite cash burn, RHI maintains a balance sheet capable of weathering downturns that would bankrupt smaller regional competitors.

**Porter's Five Forces Analysis**

1.  **Threat of New Entrants (Medium):** While the general staffing market has relatively low barriers to entry, RHI's specialization, global infrastructure, established brand, and significant technology investments (especially in AI for advanced matching and consulting) create higher hurdles for new players looking to compete at its level. However, pure-digital platforms or AI-only matching services could pose a threat at the lower-value end.
2.  **Bargaining Power of Buyers (High):** Clients possess considerable power due to the availability of numerous staffing agencies, in-house recruiting options, and alternative talent sources (e.g., freelancers). During economic downturns, client caution and reduced demand amplify this power, leading to pricing pressure and shorter contract durations. RHI’s specialization and integrated Protiviti offerings can somewhat mitigate this for higher-value engagements.
3.  **Bargaining Power of Suppliers (Medium to High - Talent):** Skilled professionals, RHI's primary "suppliers", wield significant bargaining power, especially in tight labor markets. Demand for specialized skills (e.g., tech, finance, compliance) ensures professionals can command competitive wages, impacting RHI's cost of services and gross margins. Talent attraction and retention are continuous challenges.
4.  **Threat of Substitute Products or Services (Medium to High):** Clients have various alternatives to traditional staffing and consulting services. These include direct hiring through internal HR departments, online job boards, professional networking sites (like LinkedIn), freelance platforms, and increasingly, AI-driven automation for certain tasks. The rise of hybrid work models further enables companies to tap into a broader talent pool directly. However, for specialized, project-based, or urgent needs, RHI's integrated services offer distinct advantages.
5.  **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors (High):** The industry is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. Large global players, mid-sized specialists, and numerous local firms vie for market share. Competition is based on price, quality of talent, speed of placement, and specialized expertise. This high rivalry is exacerbated during economic downturns, leading to aggressive pricing and fierce battles for limited client mandates. RHI's strong balance sheet and strategic investments enable it to compete effectively, even in challenging environments.

## 4. Investment Summary & Thesis Detail

**The Core Thesis: A Mispriced Cyclical Recovery**
The market has priced RHI for a depression, not a recession. The stock is down ~80% from highs, while the underlying business cash flows are down only ~40%. This disconnect ignores the company's operating leverage to the upside. RHI's stock has a history of losing more than 50% of its value, occuring in 2000 (-62%), 2006(-64%), 2018(-53%), and now again in 2022 (-78%). Another 43% decline occurred in 2015. The longest recovery took 8 years until a new high in the stock was established (2006-2014), while the shortest took about 2.5 years (2018-2021). The volatility in the stock is reflective of cyclicality of the industry in which it operates, but also reflects that in every previous instance in which the stock was massively struggling, it was an excellent buying opportunity. 

**Catalyst Deep Dive:**
1.  **Interest Rate Reversal:** The Federal Reserve's tightening cycle decimated temporary hiring. As rates come down, the cost of capital for RHI's clients drops, unfreezing deferred projects. The chart below shows RHI's stock price vs the 10 year treasury yield, demonstrating the sensitivity of the company's earnings and cash flows (and consequently share price) to interest rates. Red dots show dates that the FOMC announced interest rate increases.

3.  **The "White-Collar" Reshoring Wave:** Reshoring is not just about factory floors. It requires a massive logistical and administrative tail. Channel checks indicate that as manufacturing investments go live, demand for finance, HR, and supply chain roles—RHI's bread and butter—will surge.
4.  **Immigration & Labor Supply:** A tightening of U.S. immigration policy, particularly regarding H1B and skilled visas, creates a scarcity of domestic talent. In a labor-constrained environment, RHI’s proprietary database of pre-vetted domestic professionals becomes a premium asset, driving both volume and pricing power.

**Valuation and Scenario Analysis**
Our DCF model yields a **Base Case of $51 per share**, implying the stock is significantly undervalued.
*   **Bull Case ($76):**
*   **Bear Case ($28):**

**Base Case Assumptions:**
* Revenue stabilizes and shows modest growth of 2% in 2026, 5% in 2027, 6% in 2028, 5% in 2029, and a terminal growth rate of 1%. 
* Free cash flows as a percent of Sales level off at 6% and slowly rise to 7.5% of Sales by 2029. 

**Bear Case Assumptions:**
* Revenues continue to decline through 2027 (to about $4.9 billion per year) and then stay flat in perpetuity.
* Free Cash Flow as a percent of sales continues to decline from 6% to 5.5% by 2029, which stays the case in perpetuity.
* Terminal Value calculation assumption no growth at all in perpetuity.3

**Bull Case Assumptions:**
* Revenues bottom in 2025, with growth of 10% per year in 2026-2028, followed by 5% in 2029 and 2.5% in perpetuity. By 2028, RHI's revenues return to the levels of 2022.
* FCF margins mirror what happened in 2021-2022 - as revenues expanded so did FCF margins. Bull case assumes FCF expands to 8.5% of Sales by 2030.

Relative to peers, RHI trades at competitive multiples (EV/Sales of 0.74x vs. peers up to 1.14x) despite superior brand equity and the higher-margin Protiviti segment. RHI is not alone in its poor performance over the last few years. The following chart shows how $100 invested 5 years ago would have performed in RHI, its competitors, and SPY. Like RHI, MAN and KFRC (the companies most similar to RHI) hit 5 year lows in November 2025 before rebounding slightly. The fact that all three stocks behaved similarly over the 5 year period and also rebounded at nearly identical times strengthens the thesis of a cyclical turnaround in the industry. It also shows that it's likely not poor company performance that has led RHI lower. Rather, the company has been fighting headwinds that are ubiqitous across the industry.

## 5. Financial Analysis

RHI’s financials reflect the brutality of the current cycle, yet also highlight the potential for a snap-back recovery.

**Historical Performance (2021-9M 2025)**
*   **Revenue:** After peaking in 2022 ($7.24B), revenue fell 9.3% in 2024 and continued to slide 7.6% YTD in 2025.
*   **Profitability Implosion:** Net income fell nearly 50% YTD in 2025. Operating margins compressed to a razor-thin 1.0% in Q3 2025 due to negative operating leverage.
*   **Capital Allocation Red Flag:** RHI has maintained an aggressive dividend policy ($0.59/share quarterly). In the first nine months of 2025, dividend payouts ($180.3M) exceeded Net Income ($101.2M), depleting retained earnings to effectively zero. While this speaks to management's confidence in a turnaround, it is a high-risk strategy that drains liquidity.

**Forecast (Base Case)**
*   **2025:** We project a revenue decline of 7.5%. This marks the bottom.
*   **2026 (The Turn):** We forecast a 5% revenue rebound. Due to high operating leverage, this translates to a **40% surge in EBIT** and a 35% jump in Net Income.
*   **2027-2029:** Normalization to mid-single-digit revenue growth with margins expanding back toward historical averages.

**Critical Audit Matter:** Revenue recognition at Protiviti remains a complex area requiring significant judgment, identified as a CAM by auditors. While controls are effective, this remains an area of scrutiny.

## 6. Investment Risks

Investors must weigh the upside against significant risks:

*   **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** If the "soft landing" becomes a hard recession, RHI’s earnings will not recover in 2026, invalidating our immediate thesis.
*   **Legal "Tail Risk" (*Gentry v. RHI*):** The class-action lawsuit regarding recruiter classification goes to trial in November 2025. No loss provision has been recorded. An adverse judgment could result in material unquantified damages and force a business model restructure. 
*   **Dividend Sustainability:** The current payout ratio is well over 100% of earnings. If the recovery is delayed, the dividend may be cut, which could cause a sharp sell-off in the stock.
*   **AI Disruption:** A negative thesis against staffing companies is that AI technology empowers clients to bypass agencies. However, this ignores a few key points. First, RHI can also make use of AI to drive efficiencies in its own business. And second, the thesis ignores the real reason companies often use staffing agencies: liability. Employment is fraught with risks (as we'll get to in the next section regarding RHI's current lawsuit) - one lawsuit from an employee can destroy a small firm, especially in states where the legal system tends to favor the employee over employer (like California). In temp/contract staffing, the staffing company is the employer and so absorbs the risks of litigation and workers' compensation.

## 7. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Considerations

*   **Social (High Risk):** The primary ESG risk is Human Capital Management, specifically the *Gentry* and *Dorff* lawsuits alleging misclassification of employees in California. The plaintiffs claim that they are owed compensation for hours spent in preparation for an attendance of interviews with Robert Half's clients. RHI claims this preparation and interview time was voluntary and does not constitute legal "hours worked" under the law. We believe the most likely outcome is a settlement in the region of $10-50 million, which minimally impacts our DCF valuations. If the lawsuit proceeds without settlement, we believe there's a greater than 50% chance of plaintiff victory, given the legal history of similar cases in California.
*   **Governance (Medium Risk):** We scrutinize the decision to deplete retained earnings to fund dividends during a downturn. While shareholder-friendly in the short term, it raises questions about long-term financial prudence. However, the Board is well-structured, and internal controls are certified effective.
*   **Environmental (Low Risk):** As a service firm, the environmental footprint is minimal. Focus areas include energy efficiency in offices and sustainable procurement.

The ESG risks help to explain RHI's current bargain basement valuation. The market may be showing fear of a possible loss in court (which could cost the company in the range of $200-500 million), but not correctly evaluating the probability of a settlement in the $10-$50 million range (about 75% likely based on California legal history).

## 8. Analyst Note on Recent Earnings (Q3 2025)

**The Turning Point is Here.**
The Q3 2025 earnings call (Oct 23, 2025) provided the "green shoot" required to validate our thesis.

**Key Takeaways:**
1.  **Sequential Growth Guidance:** Management guided for positive adjusted sequential revenue growth in Q4 2025. This is the first time in 13 quarters this has occurred, signaling the mathematical bottom of the cycle.
2.  **Macro Improvement:** Management cited "early signs of macroeconomic improvement," including normalized trade policy and pent-up demand.
3.  **Pricing Power:** Despite volume declines, bill rates rose 3.7%, proving the franchise's resilience.

**Implication:** The projected sequential improvement confirms that the destocking cycle is ending. The market, focused on year-over-year declines, is lagging this inflection point. This validates the "Buy" rating now, before the recovery becomes obvious in headline numbers.
